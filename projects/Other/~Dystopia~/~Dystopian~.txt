RISING ACTION:
*DUAL PERSPECTIVE*
First scene is of the letter (above) burning in a fireplace.

THEO-  Theo is a high ranking officer of the rebellion. They 
       say that the government is too controlling, against what
       their constitution outlines. Throughout the story, we will
       see his Military training and use of advanced weapons as he
       leads many rebels throughout their journey to take over.
JAMES- James is a nobody. He is not part of the rebellion, has no
       military knowledge, and just wants to hide. But his friends,
       supporters of the government, try to get him to join them in 
       the fight, forcing him to choose. Eventually, he decides yes, 
       and once he puts on the armor, he knows he made the right desicion.

CLIMAX:
James leads an army of thousands of government supporters to a flat area of
land in what used to be "California." Theo and his army stand on the opposite 
end of the land and is the first to call a charge. He watches for a minute, 
then turns away while feeling for something in his pocket.
James watches as his army falls 1 for 1. In the end he is the only one left.
On either side. He faces Theo. Theo does a quick draw, and shoots James.

RESOLUTION:
Theo pulls the thing he was feeling for earlier, a piece of paper. Outlined on 
it is the constitution of the new world government. However, the consitution 
is almost exactly the same as the original.

CONCLUSION:
*THE NEW CONSTITUTION*
- New World
- No Money
- People do the jobs they want
- Must still have certifiction (but it will be easier to get)
- Laws Must Still be Enfored
- Anyone who disobeys the law will be forced to work in a area
	where work is short (i.e. jobs no one is willing to do)
- Government's job is only to enforce laws, not to protect.
- Our military will be independent of the government
- "We will no longer be known as the Nation of Earth, 
        For we are the *Realm* of Earth. We are Eternal."
